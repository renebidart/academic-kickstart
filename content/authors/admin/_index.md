## Today 
PhD Candidate in Systems Design Engineering supervised by Alexander Wong. Working on unsupervised learning. 

## Future 
I’ll be working as an applied research scientist at Amazon in Vancouver this summer.

## Background
math -> economics -> statistics -> medical imaging -> deep learning

Recently did internship at Shell Street labs using deep learning for finance, and still have some leftover interest in economics.

During Master’s in Statistics I worked on deep learning for cancerous cell detection, and presented it at SPIE medical imaging conference. I started my PhD on this topic before realizing that algorithms weren’t the bottleneck in here. 

In undergrad I studied math and economics at Carleton University, and after graduating worked at the Bank of Canada for a year, on oversight of financial market infrastructure. Between that and the university courses I became fed up with economics, and switched to something more practical.
